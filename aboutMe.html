        <h4>About the Journey</h4>
        <p>This has been the most fun, exciting, interesting, questionable, frustrating, rewarding, difficult, ambitious,
            worthwhile and gratifying venture that I have ever attempted.
        </p>
        <h4>The Places I Journeyed to</h4>
        <p>My very first stop was <span>Coursera</span> then I moved on to many other places to gain all the information
            I could. Some key places I visited are<span> Free Code Camp</span>,<span>Codecademy</span>, <span>Plural Sight
            </span>,<span> BootStrap</span>,<span> JQuery</span>,<span> W3Schools</span>, and <span>Udemy</span>
            to name a few. In addition, I have read several excerpts from books like <span>Eloquent Javascript</span>
            and <span>Pro-Git</span>.I dabbled a bit in <span>Big Nerd Ranch</span> and participated in some online coding
            Bootcamps. I have been better at version control and can find my way around a terminal( with a little help)!
            I also challenged myself with some projects I found online and ones I had some help with. This journey has not
            been on my own, My son has helped more than you can imagine and of course the countless number of places/forums
            on the web to get help. Thank You <span>Stack Over Flow
            </span>, <span>MDN</span>, <span>Free Code Camp</span> and the many other resources.
        </p>
        <h4>What I discovered on My Journey</h4>
        <p>Computer programming was initially very intimidating to me. But, I took a course on HTML and had a decent understanding
            in about a month. So onward to CSS and wow not so bad. There is always alot to learn but also lots of resources
            and a sense of accomplishment when you see that website take shape. Then came Javascript. I thought since HTML
            and CSS wasn't so bad, how hard can javascript be? I found very quickly why I was so intimidatd in the beginning.
            Javascript was not easy for me to grasp and I still struggle but I know that given the chance and some guidance
            I can make great things happen.
        </p>
        <h4>What the Next Journey is</h4>
        <p>The challenging road of seeking lucrative employment as a self taught web developer is where I am heading to now.
            I am hoping to work with a team of programmers that can help enhance my skills and understanding while building
            some really awesome sites together. Wish me luck!</p>
        <h4>The Temporary Destination</h4>
        <p>Currently I work as an Occupational Therapy Assistant and a Bartender/Server. I fit every chance I have between
            jobs, before work and before bed learning, building and developing my skills in web development.
        </p>
        <h4>Why I Take the Journey</h4>
        <p>Besides that part of my life, <span><a href="famPhoto.html">click here</a></span> to see some of the most important
            people in my world. Who are you looking at? The product of my five beautiful children all of whom I live and
            journey for.
        </p>
